# Wax Signer

Aioha may be used to sign transactions on [Wax Typescript](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/wax/-/tree/develop/ts?ref_type=heads) library.

:::note
***Wax*** here refers to the feature-rich multi-language [library](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/wax) for [Hive](https://hive.io). Not to be confused with the competing blockchain forked from EOS.
:::

## Usage

```js
import { createHiveChain } from '@hiveio/wax'
import { initAioha, WaxAiohaSigner } from '@aioha/aioha'

const aioha = initAioha()
const chain = await createHiveChain()
const tx = await chain.createTransaction()

// push some operations here...

await tx.sign(WaxAiohaSigner.for(aioha, 'active'))
await chain.broadcast(tx)
```

## Caveats

Currently most if not all providers produce signatures using the legacy serialization method, while Wax prefers the newer method supported as of HF26 which saves 4 bytes per asset/NAI value in the transaction.

In addition, Aioha primarily uses the legacy transaction JSON format (array tuple of `["operation_name", {...body}]`) while Wax primarily uses the newer JSON format of `{"type": "operation_name", value: {...body}}`.

We plan to address them in the next major breaking release of Aioha.
